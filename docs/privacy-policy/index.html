If you would like to delete your website account, please contact us by email at support@cocoonapp.ca. Your account is automatically deleted after two years of inactivity.</p><h3>Purchases through the Platform</h3><p>We will need your payment card details and billing address if you make any purchases, in order to take payment and perform refunds if necessary.

A “cookie” is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We collect cookies that are necessary for the Platform to function, cookies that enhance the Platform’s performance, and cookies used for third-party tracking. A “web beacon” is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a web page or email that can report your visit or use to a third party. Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users for the purpose of analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging. Additional information regarding web beacons is available on Wikipedia.</p><p>You can change your browser’s settings so it will stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Opt-out options for cookies are located at the account holder section of the Platform.</p><h3>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Analytics</h3><p>We may use third party cookies for the purposes of web analytics, attribution, and error management. Our Platform may use vendor services that use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, including when you pay for services, load a page, indicate that you heard about us on social media, sign up for services, enter your payment information (but the payment details are not disclosed), start the intake questionnaire, and your response as to the referral source to the Platform.</p><p>Our Platform also uses analytics vendors to collect information (for example, Visitor Data and Onboarding Data) about user actions on our Platform for purposes of analytics and analysis of certain Platform usage.</p><h3>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Advertising Networks</h3><p>You and others may see certain ads for our services or for the Platform on other websites because we may participate in ad networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These networks track individuals’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. The networks use this information to show advertisements that may be tailored to an individual’s interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection may take place both on our Platform and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and assists other websites and advertising partners to find you or people like you on different platforms, including social media websites.</p><h3>Social and General Information Tools</h3><p>We may use several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, Instagram account and others (collectively “Social and General Information Tools”). Any information you provide or share while using Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected by that site and users of that site according to their Privacy Policy.</p><p>In order to provide your subscription services, we may ask you for some of the following information.

This is to allow you to re-join the Platform during this period without having to submit your information and/or supporting documentation again.</p><p>We will retain some basic information about your Platform access for archiving and historical research or for conducting statistical analysis of our users. Where appropriate this will be anonymized and any personal data held will be kept to a minimum.</p><h3>Phishing</h3><p>Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as “phishing”, are of great concern. You should always be diligent when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system. We will never request your login information or your credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email, phone or otherwise).</p><h3>Links</h3><p>The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service. The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.</p><h3>Security of Information</h3><p>While using any Internet-based service carries inherent security risks that cannot be 100% prevented, our systems, infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built and maintained with your security and privacy in mind. We apply industry standards and best practices to prevent any unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. We comply with all applicable federal laws, provincial and state laws, and regulations regarding data privacy.</p><h3>Service Providers</h3><p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Platform, to perform certain tasks which are related to the Platform, or to provide audit, legal, operational or other services for us. These tasks include, but are not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics. We will share with them only the minimum necessary information to perform their task for us and only after entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements.</p><h3>Children’s Privacy</h3><p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to become our user. The Platform is not directed and not intended to be used by children under the age of 13. If you are aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13 please let us know by contacting us and we will delete that information.</p><h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3><p>We cooperate with governments and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose information necessary or appropriate to protect the safety of the public or any person, to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), and to prevent or stop activity that may be illegal or dangerous. You should also be aware that Counsellors may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, and without limitation, you should be aware that the law requires mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action including but not limited to the following cases: (a) reported or suspected abuse of a child or vulnerable adult; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm to another person; (d) court-ordered presentation of treatment.</p><h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3><p>We may update this privacy statement at our sole discretion. The date of the last revision of this policy appears at the end of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our Privacy Policy and practices. Regardless of changes to our Privacy Policy, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first notifying you and giving you the option to stop using the Platform.</p><h3>Contacting us</h3><p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy-related practices, please email us at support@cocoonapp.ca</p><p>‍</p><h3>CALIFORNIA – Privacy Notice for California Residents</h3><p>This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements and is expressly made part of the information contained in the Privacy Policy and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”).
